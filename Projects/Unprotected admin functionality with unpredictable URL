Imagine an application that hosts administrative functions at the following URL:
https://insecure-website.com/administrator-panel-yb556

The URL might be disclosed in JavaScript that constructs the user interface based: 

var isAdmin = false;
	if (isAdmin) {
		...
		var adminPanelTag = document.createElement('a');
		adminPanelTag.setAttribute('https://insecure-website.com/administrator-panel-yb556');
		adminPanelTag.innerText = 'Admin panel';
		...
		
		
THE LAB 

FIRST WAY https://web-security-academy.net/ AND ADD "/robots.txt" -> no results 
SECOND WAY -> right-click and inspect source page -> in the HTML body you will find "/admin-d1sedi" (admin directory) 
-> go back and add "https://web-security-academy.net/admin-d1sedi" -> you got into the admin directory
