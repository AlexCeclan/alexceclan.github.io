The Qualys VMDR lifecycle is a continuous, seamlessly orchestrated workflow of automated asset discovery, vulnerability management, threat prioritization, and remediation.


Where clound agents can be deployed?
-> remote users
-> IAAS providers
-> Corporate environment 

when in Qualys -> go to CLOUD AGENT and pick -> Agent summary and pay attention to the Agent ID - THE VULNERABILITY INFORMATION IS ASSOCIATED TO THIS AGENT ID 

Qualys -> Cloud Agent -> VMDR -> Assets -> Address Management -> the list of machine are scannable hosts and don't have the agent on them 
          -> if you want to add more press New -> IP Tracked Address -> you can add one IP, a range of IP's and press ADD
		  
The first stage of the VMDR lifecycle is Asset Management -> Itâ€™s essential to have a complete, updated global inventory of all assets across your network: on prem, endpoints, clouds, containers, mobile, OT and IoT 

Different Sensors provided by Qualys:
1. Local Scanners are deployed on local area networks and commonly scan assets within reserved or private IP address ranges. 
   - These local scanners can be deployed as physical or virtual appliances.
	
2. Qualys Cloud Agents run as a local process on the host they protect. Qualys agents support a wide variety of OS platforms. 

3. Qualys Passive Sensors can be deployed as physical or virtual appliances.  Passive sensors operate by sniffing network traffic sent to the Qualys platform for processing.

4. Cloud and SaaS Connectors work with the native services of your cloud and SaaS providers to identify misconfigurations and security blind spots. 

5. Qualys Container Sensor downloads as a Docker image and is installed on a Docker host as a container application, right alongside other container applications. Container Sensor will assess all new and existing Docker images and containers for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

6. Out-of-band Sensors help to secure devices on air-gapped networks.

7. APIs collect data from third parties. 

LINUX BASED HOSTS ARE ADDED -> ADDRESS MANAGEMENT -> NEW -> DNS Tracked
WINDOWS BASED HOSTS ARE ADDED -> ADDRESS MAANGEMENT -> NEW -> NETBIOS

How to deploy an agent?
Press Configure Agents for VMDR -> Manage Cloud Agent Key -> Cloud Agents -> Activation Keys -> New Key -> Create -> No Dynamic Rule pick in step 2 and finish 
-> How the provision keys work and press one -> press generate -> 
CSAM = IT WILL COLLECT INVENTORY DATA ABOUT THE Asset
Vulnerability Management = will collect vulnerability data for the host
Secure Config = can gather config datapoints on agent hosts to built policies for compliance
Patch Management = to pach discovered vulenrabilities 

How to perform agent instalation?
Activation Keys -> quick action and install agent -> pick the operating system based on host -> click downlaod 

You need to scan private IP address ranges in a local area network. -> use Physical Scanner Appliance and Virtual Scanner Appliance
