Reading arbitrary files via path traversal!!!

Imagine a shopping application that displays images of items for sale. This might load an image using the following HTML:
<img src="/loadImage?filename=218.png">


!!!!ON UNIX BASED, an attacker can request the following URL to retrieve the /etc/passwd file:
https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=../../../etc/passwd

You have to change after = the "218.png" with ../../../etc/passwd -> it gives root privileges, so you can access the files.


!!!!ON WINDOWS BASED, the same technique can be used: 
https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=..\..\..\windows\win.ini

..\..\..\windows\win.ini -> giving root privileges.


HOW TO USE IT WITH BURP?

Open Burp -> check "HTTP History" -> look for the JPEG files or "filename=10.jpg" -> right-click on one and Send to Repeater 
-> go to repeater and change ="10.jpg" into ../../../etc/passwd and press SEND -> on right you will have the results
