Horizontal privilege escalation attacks may use similar types of exploit methods to vertical privilege escalation. 
For example, a user might access their own account page using the following URL:
https://insecure-website.com/myaccount?id=123

If an attacker modifies the id parameter value to that of another user, they might gain access to another user's account page

The LBA

you connect to the account -> go on Home tab and check for articlers written by admin or Carlos -> press on their name
-> while doing this you have in Burp all the details -> check in Burp for (GET) "/blogs?userid=....." here you have the ID of Carlos so copy it
-> send to repeater (GET) "/my-account?id=..." and change your ID into Carlos ID and hit Send -> look for Carlos and his API key
