Broken access controls are common and often present a critical security vulnerability. 

Vertical privilege escalation arises where an application does not enforce any protection for sensitive functionality. 
For example, administrative functions might be linked from an administrator's welcome page but not from a user's welcome page.

In some cases, the administrative URL might be disclosed in other locations, such as the robots.txt:

https://insecure-website.com/robots.txt

/robots.txt - added = WIN

THE LAB:

In this case we have this website 

https://web-security-academy.net -> add after ".net" add the "/robots.txt." and hit enter -> it will appear the path to admin panel "Disallow: /administrator-panel" - you know now the admin account
go back to webpage and press "My account" -> it will redirect you to login page
A new address: https://web-security-academy.net/login -> delete "login" and add "/administrator-panel" -> you are inside as an admin

What we are trying is to brute force the administrator panel endpoint without using any credentials.
