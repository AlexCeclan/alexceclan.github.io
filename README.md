### About me
I am Alex, a passionate person for Cyberspace and physical security. In short, this page is intended to document my learning path towards becoming an expert in the Cyber Security field, more specifically to expand my expertise in the penetration-testing area and vulnerability management. <br/>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently organizing and managing PCI DSS penetration-tests, and leading the vulnerability management side.
- ðŸ‘¯ I love sharing my experience and knowledge with others. Exchanging ideas and experiences between individuals would bring only positive outcomes. 
- â˜• For me a perfect cup of coffee will brighten up the dark days. 
- âš¡ A fun fact is that Mr. Robot TV series made me do this.



###  Hobbies that Iâ€™m currently challenging myself
Since I do want to be an expert in the security field and become a certified pen-tester, I decided to take more time focusing on feeding more knowledge to myself. As such, I set a couple of self-challenges to push myself further.

* Learn to pen-test in Kali Linux (plus Nmap, Wireshark and Burp Suite) :man_technologist: 1-2 hours a day without distraction.
* Read :newspaper: and be always up-to-date with major security and political news, and not only. 
* Workout:weight_lifting_man: by going to the gym at least 3 times a week, for a healthy body.  
* Avoid spending too much time on TikTok or Youtube :skull_and_crossbones:.
